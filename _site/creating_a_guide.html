    <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4>

<p>Meaning-carrying tools, like handbooks or maps, can help people use an
idea, collecting content and stories.</p>

<h4 id="problem">Problem:</h4>

<p>When the idea or system is only “newly discovered”, the associated
meanings may not be well understood, and indeed they may not have been
created. Even if a topic is only “personally new”, it can be hard to
find ones way around.</p>

<h4 id="solution">Solution:</h4>

<p>In such a case, the process of creating the guide can go hand-in-hand
with figuring out how the system works. Thus, techniques of <a href="http://knowledgecartography.org/">knowledge
cartography</a> and <a href="http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/r-97-47/two.html">meaning
making</a>
are useful for would-be guide creators.</p>

<h4 id="example">Example:</h4>

<p>We started the Peeragogy project by collaboratively making an outline
for the Peeragogy Handbook. We recommended this handbook-making practice
to others, as a way to learn collaboratively and build a strong group.</p>

<h4 id="challenges">Challenges:</h4>

<p>Remember that “the map is not the territory,” and map-making is only one
facet of shared human activity. For instance, a pattern description can
be thought of as a “micro-map” of a specific activity. These maps are
not useful if they are divorced from practice.</p>

<h4 id="whats-next">What’s Next:</h4>

<p>We’ve been talking with collaborators in the Commons Abundance Network
about how to make a Pattern Language for the Commons. One of the
challenges that arises is how to support ongoing development of the
Pattern Language itself: a “living” map for a living territory. We’re
refining the Peeragogy Pattern language and template as a seed for this.</p>
