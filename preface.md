title: Preface to the Third Edition
---
The Second Edition of the *Handbook* came out two years ago.
We've been keeping at it since then.  This time around, we're kicking
things off with a short workbook that contains a concise guide to the
who, what, when, where, how and why of peeragogy.  We've thoroughly
revised the pattern catalog at the heart of the book, added more case
studies, and made numerous small improvements to the text (and the
typesetting!)  throughout.
