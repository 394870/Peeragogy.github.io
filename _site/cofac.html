    <p>Facilitation is a process of helping groups work cooperatively and
effectively. Facilitation can be particularly helpful for individuals
who, based on a certain level of insecurity or inexperience, tend to
lurk rather than participate.  At the same time, it in peeragogy, a
facilitator isn’t necessarily an “authority”: rather, facilitation work
is done in service to the group and the group dialogue and process.  For
example, a facilitator may simply “hold space” for the group, by setting
up a meeting or a regular series of discussions.</p>

<h2 id="co-facilitating-in-peer-to-peer-learning">Co-facilitating in peer-to-peer learning</h2>

<p>Co-facilitation can be found in collaborations between two or
more people who need each other to complete a task, for example, learn
about a given subject, author a technical report, solve a problem, or
conduct research Dee Fink writes that “in this process, there has to be
some kind of change in the learner. No change, no learning”
<span>[</span>1<span>]</span>. Significant learning requires that there
be some kind of lasting change that is important in terms of the
learner’s life; in peeragogy, one way to measure the effectiveness of
co-facilitation is to look for a change in the peer group.</p>

<p>Co-facilitation roles can be found in groups/teams like basketball,
health, Alcoholics Anonymous, spiritual groups, etc. For example,
self-help groups are composed of people who gather to share common
problems and experiences associated with a particular problem,
condition, illness, or personal circumstance.  There are some further
commonalities across different settings.  Commenting on the work of Carl
Rogers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Godfrey Barrett-Lennard</strong>: The educational situation which most
effectively promotes significant learning is one in which (1) threat
to the self of the learner is reduced a minimum, and (2)
differentiated perception of the field of experience is facilitated.
<span>[</span>2<span>]</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of the facilitator’s role is to create a safe place for learning to
take place; but they should also challenge the participants.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>John Heron</strong>: Too much hierarchical control, and participants become
passive and dependent or hostile and resistant. They wane in
self-direction, which is the core of all learning. Too
much cooperative guidance may degenerate into a subtle kind of
nurturing oppression, and may deny the group the benefits of totally
autonomous learning. Too much autonomy for participants and
laissez-faire on your part, and they may wallow in ignorance,
misconception, and chaos. <span>[</span>3<span>]</span></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="co-facilitating-discussion-forums">Co-facilitating discussion forums</h2>

<p>If peers are preparing a forum discussion, here are some ideas from
“<a href="http://ctb.ku.edu/en/tablecontents/section_1180.aspx">The Community Tool
Box</a>”, that can be
helpful as guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Explain the importance of collaborative group work and make it a
requirement.</li>
  <li>Establish how you will communicate in the forum.</li>
  <li>Be aware of mutual blind spots in facilitating and observing others.</li>
  <li>Watch out for different rhythms of intervention.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="co-facilitatingwiki-workflows">Co-facilitating wiki workflows</h2>

<p>A good place to begin for any group of co-facilitators working with a
wiki are Wikipedia’s famous “5 Pillars.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.</li>
  <li>Wikipedia writes articles from a neutral point-of-view.</li>
  <li>Wikipedia is free content that anyone can edit, use, modify, and
distribute.</li>
  <li>Editors should interact with each other in a respectful and civil
manner.</li>
  <li>Wikipedia does not have firm rules.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="co-facilitating-live-sessions">Co-facilitating live sessions</h2>

<p>Learning experiences in live sessions are described in the article
<a href="http://dmlcentral.net/blog/howard-rheingold/learning-reimagined-participatory-peer-global-online">Learning Re-imagined: Participatory, Peer, Global,
Online</a>
by Howard Rheingold, and many of these points are revisited in the
handbook section on <a href="http://peeragogy.org/real-time-meetings/">real-time
tools</a>.  But we want to
emphasize one point here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Howard Rheingold</strong>: Remember you came together with your peers to
accomplish something, not to discuss an agenda or play with
online tools; keep everything as easily accessible as possible to
ensure you realize your goals.</p>
