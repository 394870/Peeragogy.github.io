<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>A lot of “education” assumes we are speaking to a new generation. In
learning more broadly, the “audience” is often new to the topic.
Sometimes we are the , sometimes we’re the oldtimers.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>can feel overwhelmed by the amount of things to learn. They don’t know
where to start.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> They may have a bunch of ideas that the oldtimers
have never considered – or they may think they have new ideas, which are
actually a different take on old ideas; see .</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>It is good to try to become aware of what a needs, and what their
motivations are.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> themselves may have only a general idea about what
their goals are, so it can be helpful to add concreteness with .</p>

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>

<p>in the Peeragogy project have often complained about feeling confused
about what the project is about, suggesting that our has not been
sufficiently clear. Some feel it is too theoretical, which suggests we
need to do more work on on ways to get involved, while also making it
clear that we do not have an exhaustive list in mind. New ideas can
prompt us to consider how we may have been limiting ourselves.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>

<p>The frustration and confusion felt by a familiar to anyone who is
starting something new. An awareness of how to help can help us be more
compassionate to ourselves and others.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h3>

<p>A more detailed (but non-limiting) “How to Get Involved” walk-through in
text or video form would be good to develop. We can start by listing
some of the things we’re learning about.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>Peeragogy Project participant Régis Barondeau: “I joined this
handbook project late, making me a ‘newcomer’. When I started to
catch up, I rapidly faced doubts: Where do I start? How can I help?
How will I make it, having to read more than 700 posts to catch up?
What tools are we using ? How do I use them? Etc. Although this
project is amazingly interesting, catching the train while it
already reached high speed can be an extreme sport. By taking care
of newcomers, we might avoid losing valuable contributors because
they don’t know how and where to start, and keep our own project on
track.” <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Peeragogy Project participant Charlotte Pierce: “Joe was working a
lot on the book, and I thought ‘this is interesting hard work, and
he shouldn’t have to do this alone.’ As a Peeragogy newcomer, I was
kindly welcomed and mentored by Joe, Howard, Fabrizio, and others. I
asked naive questions and was met with patient answers, guiding
questions, and resource links. Concurrently, I bootstrapped myself
into a position to contribute to the workflow by editing the live
manuscript for consistency, style, and continuity.” <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Dilrukshi Gamage, Julia Echeverria, and Federico Monaco first
joined a Peeragogy hangout in February, 2015. They were all
interested in the idea of designing and running a course on peer
learning. Although we had done some work on a syllabus, and
considered the notion of using peeragogical models in formal
education, we hadn’t tried running a course on the topic of
peeragogy. There were a number of earlier experiments that <em>used</em>
ideas from peeragogy inside of a formal course, and the difference
between these two approaches prompted interesting discussions. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
