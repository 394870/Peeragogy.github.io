<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>We’ve maintained and revised our pattern catalog over a period of years.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>Some of the patterns don’t seem to lead to concrete next steps.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>We’ve created a for patterns that are no longer part of the active
catalog.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> It’s worth remembering how we got to the point we’re at
now, and the thinking that developed along the way, so the shows some
patterns that seemed like a good idea at the time – and brief notes
about why we no longer need them explicitly. We can use the to decide
when to move a pattern into the .</p>

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>

<p>We want our collection of patterns to be concretely useful and actively
used. It needs to be clear and pragmatic, and not overly theoretical or
prescriptive. If we don’t see “what’s next” and where it came from, then
it’s probably time to shift focus to something else more practical.</p>

<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>

<p>After noticing that the idea of a can help us focus and help us present
our work to others, we’ve decided to “retire” several patterns that
seemed overly abstract or redundant as well as several antipatterns that
didn’t suggest concrete next steps, and instead simply held a prism to
our collective frustrations with the slow pace of a distributed
volunteer project.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> The current catalog is leaner and redescribes our
project in an action-oriented way.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next</h3>

<p>After significantly pruning back the pattern catalog, we want it to grow
again: new patterns are needed. Reviewing the contents of the will be
one place to look for inspiration, but there are others.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
