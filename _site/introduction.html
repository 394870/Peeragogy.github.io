<p>—<em>Peeragogy</em> is a flexible framework of techniques for peer learning and
peer knowledge production. As pedagogy theoretically articulates the
transmission of knowledge from teachers to students, peeragogy describes
the way peers produce and utilize knowledge together. With OER, wikis,
the internet, Free Software and mobile networks, groups of people can
learn, connect and create knowledge together inside and outside of
formal institutions in ways never before possible. These tools can
facilitate connected learning, and collaborative engagement but they
only work well when combined with practices that work well for the
people involved.</p>

<p>The learning mind-set and new strategies for good faith collaboration
that we are uncovering in the Peeragogy project can be applied in
classrooms, hackerspaces, business meetings, wiki projects and
interconnected collaborations across an entire society.  In this book
we will examine the way the values that helped shape Wikipedia and
free software can be applied in other learning contexts.  We draw on
our experience as practitioners of “Mode 2” knowledge production
(i.e. in <em>loosely knit multidisciplinary teams working together for
short periods of time on specific real-world problems</em>) – both as
co-authors of this book and in a wide variety of other projects.  As
you read, you are invited to look for further applications of
peeragogy in your life and in the world around you. We begin with a
quick walkthrough of the Peeragogy concept, some warm-up exercises,
and a Peeragogy project directory that we think will be helpful as you
get started:</p>
