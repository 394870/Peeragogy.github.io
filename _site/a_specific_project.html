    <h1 id="a-specific-project">A specific project</h1>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>You find yourself interested in or concerned about something, but you
only have a vague idea about how it works or how you fit in.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>It’s easy to think about issues that matter: there are many of them. The
problem is figuring out what you’re going to do about it. As a further
problem, getting concrete can be scary, because you risk failure.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>If you <em>are</em> able to get concrete about something to do, learn, and
achieve, you move from thinking about a topic to becoming a
practitioner. You may realize that your “specific project” is too large
to tackle directly. In this case, you will have to become even more
specific. Maintaining a project <span><strong>Roadmap</strong></span> can help keep
track of the smaller pieces and the bigger picture.</p>

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>

<p>Being specific is important for bringing about to change.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> But while
actions speak louder than words, it’s important to act in a coherent way
if you want to be understood by others. However, in general it would be
a mistake to try to seek consensus before acting: it’s much better to
combine action with dialog.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h3>

<p>Each project connected with the Peeragogy Project should be described
with one or more patterns, each with specific, tangible “what’s next”
steps.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> The <span><strong>Pattern Audit Routine</strong></span> can help make
these “what’s next” steps concrete.</p>

    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>In the Peeragogy project and more broadly, we’ve observed that
some people are happy with a sense of experience or process, while
others want to see results. Some others are in the middle. All of
these variations are OK! However, we are often blinded by our own
preferences, and in the worst case this can undermine or destroy
group dynamics. At the very least it will add tension, as some want
to continue to discuss and engage generally while others want to
move forward. When the forward-movers try to act, those enjoying the
experience may attempt to shut them down or may feel that they are
being left out/behind. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>In the January, 2013, plenary session, <a href="http://ipne.org">Independent Publishers of
New England</a> (IPNE) President Tordis Isselhardt
quietly listened to a presentation about how we created the
<em>Peeragogy Handbook</em>. During the Q&amp;A, she spoke up, wondering if
peer-learning effort in IPNE might be more likely to succeed if the
organization’s members “focused around a specific project.” As this
lightbulb illuminated the room, those of us attending the plenary
session suggested that IPNE could focus the project by creating an
“Independent Publishing Handbook.” (Applause!) In the course of
creating the IPNE Handbook, peer learners would assemble resource
repositories, exchange expertise, and collaboratively edit
documents. To provide motivation and incentive to participate in
“PeerPubU”, members of the association will earn authorship credit
for contributing articles, editor credit for working on the
manuscript, and can spin off their own chapters as stand-alone,
profit-making publications. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>We’ve found that writing papers for conferences is one activity
that can help us focus and make improvements to our body of work
that would not come about by simply meandering through revisions to
the <em>Peeragogy Handbook</em>. Remixing these efforts into the handbook
is a good source of improvements; see <span><strong>Use or Make</strong></span>. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
