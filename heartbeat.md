Heartbeat {#sec:Heartbeat}
=========

### Context {#context .unnumbered}

People have a shared interest, and have connected with each other about
it.

### Problem {#problem .unnumbered}

What’s an easy way for those people to feel like there’s a *there,
there?*

### Solution {#solution .unnumbered}

People seem to naturally gravitate to regularly scheduled activities.
Once a week (meetings) or once a year (conferences, festivals) are two
common variants. Sometimes people need a little extra prompt to join
in.[^1] When the project is bigger than more than just a few people,
it’s likely to have several .[^2]

### Rationale {#rationale .unnumbered}

This pattern might seem too obvious, since regularly scheduled meetings
are so ubiquitous. But there’s an important difference between a mere
meeting and a : in short, if the energy from your meetings isn’t helping
you or your group thrive, something needs to change.

### Resolution {#resolution .unnumbered}

This pattern is one of the easiest ones to use to introduce to the idea
of a design pattern, since everyone is familiar with the pattern of a
supportive routine. But it is also a sophisticated tool: noticing when a
new is beginning to emerge is a way to be aware of the priorities in the
group, and may be a good source of new patterns. Similarly, noticing
when a specific has faded may be a sign that one of our patterns should
be moved to the .

### What’s Next {#whats-next .unnumbered}

Identifying and fostering new and new working groups is a task that can
help make the community more robust. This is the temporal dimension of
spin off projects described in .

[^1]: In the “Collaborative Lesson Planning” course led by Charlie
    Danoff at P2PU, Charlie wrote individual emails to people who were
    signed up for the course and who had disappeared, or lurked but
    didn’t participate. This helped course participants re-engage and
    make positive contributions. In more recent months, Charlotte Pierce
    has been the primary driver behind weekly meetings run using Google
    Hangout to coordinate work on the *Peeragogy Handbook* as well as
    tending to to other community interests. Not only have we gotten a
    lot of hands-on editorial work done this way, we’ve generated a
    tremendous amount of new material (both text and video footage) that
    is likely to find its way into future versions of the *Peeragogy
    Handbook*. As long as this continues, “Mondays at 1PM Eastern US
    time” is a reliable time to make contact with the Peeragogy Project.

[^2]: There have been several periods of time operated two regularly
    scheduled weekly meetings in the Peeragogy project at distinct time
    slots, for members with slightly different interests and slightly
    different availability. This typically relates to small
    special-purpose projects, like our work on this paper.
