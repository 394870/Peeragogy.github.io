    <h1 id="distributed-roadmap">Distributed Roadmap</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>This section reprises the “What’s Next” steps in all the previous
patterns, offering another view on the project
<strong>Roadmap</strong> in its emergent form.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="peeragogy-project">▶ Peeragogy project</h3>

<p>Feel free to join us and suggest new patterns and projects, or adapt our
patterns to help shape another <strong>Peeragogy Project</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="roadmap">▶ Roadmap</h3>

<p>Adding “What’s Next” steps to our patterns gives us a “distributed
roadmap.” And this works both ways: If we sense that something needs to
change about the project, that is a clue that we might need to record a
new pattern.</p>

<h3 id="use-or-make">▶ Use or make</h3>

<p>We’ve spun off the pattern catalog from the <em>Peeragogy Handbook</em> into
this paper, sharing it with a new community and gaining new
perspectives. Let’s look for other parts of the handbook we can spin
off!</p>

<h3 id="carrying-capacity">▶ Carrying capacity</h3>

<p>This pattern catalog has been rewritten in a way that should make it
easy for anyone to add new patterns. Making it easy and fruitful for
others to get involved is one of the best ways to redistribute the load
(compare the <strong>Newcomer</strong> pattern).</p>

<h3 id="a-specific-project">▶ A specific project</h3>

<p>Each project connected with the Peeragogy project should be described
with one or more patterns, each with specific, tangible “what’s next”
steps. The <strong>Pattern Audit Routine</strong> can help make these
“what’s next” steps concrete.</p>

<h3 id="wrapper">▶ Wrapper</h3>

<p>We need better practices for automating the wrapping-up process. One of
the latest ideas is to develop a simple visual “dashboard” for the
project that would be a web page people could access and immediately get
an idea of what work is ongoing in the project with links for going more
in depth and/or contributing.</p>

<h3 id="heartbeat">▶ Heartbeat</h3>

<p>Identifying and fostering new <strong>Heartbeats</strong> and new
working groups is a task that can help make the community more robust.
This is the temporal dimension of spin off projects described in
<strong>Use or Make</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-guide">▶ Creating a guide</h3>

<p>Working with our shepherd at PLoP to improve this paper!</p>

<h3 id="newcomer">▶ Newcomer</h3>

<p>A more detailed (but non-limiting) “How to Get Involved” walk-through in
text or video form would be good to develop. We can start by listing
some of the things we’re learning about.</p>

<h3 id="pattern-audit-routine">▶ Pattern Audit Routine</h3>

<p>Regularly go through the <strong>Pattern Audit Routine</strong> in our
future meetings.</p>

<h3 id="scrapbook">▶ Scrapbook</h3>

<p>After significantly pruning back the pattern catalog, we want it to grow
again: new patterns are needed. Reviewing the contents of the
<strong>Scrapbook</strong> will be one place to look for inspiration,
but there are others.</p>
