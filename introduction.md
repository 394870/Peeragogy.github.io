> We live where no one knows the answer and the struggle is to figure out the question. [1]

Welcome to the _Peeragogy Handbook_!  We want to kick things off with
a candid confession: we're not going to pretend that this book is
perfect.  In fact, it's not an ordinary book at all.  The adventure
starts when you get out your pen or pencil and begin marking it up.
Things will really get cooking if you join our virtual community and
start sharing your concerns.  If everything goes as planned you'll get
a lot of friendly support and perhaps some unexpected challenges as
you write your own peeragogical adventure.  But first, what is
*peeragogy*?

Peeragogy is a flexible framework of techniques for peer learning
and peer knowledge production.  As pedagogy theoretically articulates
the transmission of knowledge from teachers to students, peeragogy
describes the way peers produce and use knowledge together.
The learning mind-set and new strategies for "good faith
collaboration" [2] that we are uncovering in the Peeragogy project can
be applied in classrooms, hackerspaces, business meetings, wiki
projects and interconnected collaborations across an entire society.

The _Peeragogy Handbook_ is a compendium of know how for any group of
people who want to co-learn any subject together, when none of them is
an expert in the particular subject matter -- learning together
without one traditional teacher, especially using the tools and
knowledge available online.
What we say in the _Handbook_ draws extensively on our experiences working together
on the _Handbook_ -- and our experiences in other collaborative
projects that drew us here in the first place.  The best way to learn about peeragogy is
to get involved in putting peeragogy into action.  Towards that end,
coauthors and fans of the _Handbook_ have an active Google+ community,
conveniently called "Peeragogy in Action".  We maintain a regular
schedule of weekly meetings that you're welcome to jump into.  The
_Handbook_ includes a short syllabus, also called "Peeragogy in
Action", that you can work through with your own group.

You're warmly invited to combine your local projects with the global
effort, and get involved in making the next edition of the book.  That
doesn't necessarily require you to do extensive writing or editing.
We're always interested in new use cases, tricky problems, and
interesting questions.  In fact, our view is that any question is a
good question.

Here is a more detailed list of ways in which the current edition of
the _Handbook_ is not perfect.  You're welcome to add to the list!
These are places where you can jump in and get involved.  We believe
that airing our dirty laundry up front will give you a good idea of
the issues and challenges we face putting peeragogy into action.  If
you're not intrigued by this sort of challenge, you may be best served
by a different adventure.

# Maintaining a list of useful resources

We include references and recommended reading in the _Handbook_, and
there are a lot more links that have been shared in the Peeragogy in
Action community.  It's a ongoing task to catalog and improve these
resources -- including books, videos, images, projects, technology,
etc.  In short, let's "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle"!  As a good start,
Charlotte Pierce has been maintaining a spreadsheet under the heading
"survey" in our Google Drive.

# Developing a really accessible DIY tool-kit

A short "workbook" containing interviews and some activities follows
this introduction, but it could be much more interactive.  Amanda
Lyons and Paola Ricuarte made several new exercises and drawings that
we could include. A more developed workbook could be split off from
the handbook into a separate publication.  It would be great to have
something simple for onramping.  For example, the workbook could be
accompanied by video tutorials for new contributors.

Paola Ricuarte points out that a really useful book will be easy to
sell.  For teachers interested in peeragogy, this needs to be
something that can be use in workshops or on their own, to write in,
to think through issues.  We're partway there, but to improve things,
we really need a better set of activities.

The next time Paola or someone else uses the handbook or handbook to
run a workshop, she can say, "turn to this page, let's answer this
question, you have 5 minutes."  There are lots of places where the
writing in the handbook could be made more interactive.  One technique
Paola and Amanda used was turning "statements" from the handbook into
"questions."

# Crafting a visual identity

Amanda also put together the latest cover art, with some collaboration
from Charlotte using inDesign.  A more large-scale visual design would
be a good goal for the 4th Edition of the book.  Fabrizio Terzi, who
made the handbook cover art for the 1st Edition, has recently been working
on making our website more friendly.  So, again, work is in progress
but we could use your help.

# Workflow for the 4th edition

We've uploaded the content of the book to Github and are editing the
"live" version of the site in Markdown.  For previous print editions,
we've converted to LaTeX.  There are a number of workflow bottlenecks:
First, people need to be comfortable updating the content on the site.
Second, it would be good to have more people involved with the
technical editing work that goes into compiling for print.  Remember,
when we produce an actual physical handbook, we can sell it.  In fact,
because all co-authors have transferred their copyright in this book
to the Public Domain, _anyone_ can print and sell copies, convert the
material into new interactive forms, or do just about anything with
it.

# Translations

Translating a book that's continually being revised is pretty much a
nightmare.  It might be better to just pay professional translators.
But for that, we'll need a pretty serious budget.  See below.

# Next steps? What's the future of the project?

In short: If we make the Handbook even more useful, then it will be no
problem to sell more copies of it.  That is one way to make money to
cover future expenses.  It's a paradigmatic example for other business
models we might use in the future.
