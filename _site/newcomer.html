    <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4>

<p>Unless there is a new person to talk to, a lot of the “education stuff”
we do could grow pretty stale. Many of the patterns and use cases for
peeragogy assume that there will be an audience or a new generation of
learners.</p>

<h4 id="problem">Problem:</h4>

<p>Some of the problems are well summed up with a quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Régis Barondeau</strong>: I joined this handbook project late, making me a
“newcomer”. When I started to catch up, I rapidly faced doubts: Where
do I start? How can I help? How will I make it, having to read more
than 700 posts to catch up? What tools are we using ? How do I use
them? Etc. Although this project is amazingly interesting, catching
the train while it already reached high speed can be an extreme sport.
By taking care of newcomers, we might avoid losing valuable
contributors because they don’t know how and where to start, and keep
our own project on track.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="solution">Solution:</h4>

<p>It is good to try to become aware of what a newcomer needs, and what
their motivations are. Another quote can illustrate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Charlotte Pierce</strong>: Joe was working a lot on the book, and I thought
“this is interesting hard work, and he shouldn’t have to do this
alone.” As a Peeragogy newcomer, I was kindly welcomed and mentored by
Joe, Howard, Fabrizio, and others. I asked naive questions and was met
with patient answers, guiding questions, and resource links.
Concurrently, I bootstrapped myself into a position to contribute to
the workflow by editing the live manuscript for consistency, style,
and continuity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="challenges">Challenges:</h4>

<p>Newcomers in the Peeragogy project have often complained about feeling
confused, suggesting that our project roadmap that the newcomer and the
<a href="http://peeragogy.org/practice/roadmap/">roadmap</a> may not be
sufficiently clear, and that more work has to be done the project
accessible. Even in the absence of actual newcomers, we need to try and
look at things with a beginner’s mind.</p>

<h4 id="whats-next">What’s Next:</h4>

<p>We recently revised the “How to Get Involved” page, listing the top ten
sites we use. Another reasonable thing to post would be a top-ten list
of activities, so that people can get an easier view on the kinds of
things we do in the project.</p>
