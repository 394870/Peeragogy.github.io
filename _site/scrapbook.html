    <h1 id="scrapbook">Scrapbook</h1>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>We’ve maintained and revised our pattern catalog over a period of years.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>Some of the patterns don’t seem to lead to concrete next steps.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>We’ve created a <span><strong>Scrapbook</strong></span> for patterns that are no
longer part of the active catalog.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> It’s worth remembering how we got
to the point we’re at now, and the thinking that developed along the
way, so the <span><strong>Scrapbook</strong></span> shows some patterns that seemed
like a good idea at the time – and brief notes about why we no longer
need them explicitly. We can use the <span><strong>Pattern Audit
Routine</strong></span> to decide when to move a pattern into the
<span><strong>Scrapbook</strong></span>.</p>

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>

<p>We want our collection of patterns to be concretely useful and actively
used. It needs to be clear and pragmatic, and not overly theoretical or
prescriptive. If we don’t see “what’s next” and where it came from, then
it’s probably time to shift focus to something else more practical.</p>

<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>

<p>After noticing that the idea of a <span><strong>Scrapbook</strong></span> can help us
focus and help us present our work to others, we’ve decided to “retire”
several patterns that seemed overly abstract or redundant as well as
several antipatterns that didn’t suggest concrete next steps, and
instead simply held a prism to our collective frustrations with the slow
pace of a distributed volunteer project.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> The current catalog is
leaner and redescribes our project in an action-oriented way.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next</h3>

<p>After significantly pruning back the pattern catalog, we want it to grow
again: new patterns are needed. Reviewing the contents of the
<span><strong>Scrapbook</strong></span> will be one place to look for inspiration,
but there are others.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>See <a href="http://paragogy.net/Pattern_Scrapbook">http://paragogy.net/Pattern_Scrapbook</a>. Note that the
patterns in our <span><strong>Scrapbook</strong></span> use a slightly different
template to the one we’ve currently adopted. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>Retired patterns: <span><strong>Discerning a pattern</strong></span>,
<span><strong>Polling for ideas</strong></span>, <span><strong>Moderation</strong></span>,
<span><strong>Roles</strong></span>. Retired antipatterns:
<span><strong>Isolation</strong></span>, <span><strong>Magical thinking</strong></span>,
<span><strong>Messy with Lurkers</strong></span>, <span><strong>Misunderstanding
Power</strong></span>, <span><strong>Navel Gazing</strong></span>,
<span><strong>Stasis</strong></span>, <span><strong>Stuck at the Level of Weak
Ties</strong></span>. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>The <span><strong>Scrapbook</strong></span> could potentially be called an
“<span><strong>Icebox</strong></span>” to emphasize that the patterns it contains
may prove useful at a later date. Symmetrically, one of the tasks of
the <span><strong>Wrapper</strong></span> should be to maintain a
“<span><strong>Backlog</strong></span>” of proto-patterns, in the form of
outstanding problems and issues. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
