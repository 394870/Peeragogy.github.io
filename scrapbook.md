### Context 

We’ve maintained and revised our pattern catalog over a period of years.

### Problem 

Some of the patterns don’t seem to lead to concrete next steps.

### Solution 

We’ve created a for patterns that are no longer part of the active
catalog.[^1] It’s worth remembering how we got to the point we’re at
now, and the thinking that developed along the way, so the shows some
patterns that seemed like a good idea at the time – and brief notes
about why we no longer need them explicitly. We can use the to decide
when to move a pattern into the .

### Rationale 

We want our collection of patterns to be concretely useful and actively
used. It needs to be clear and pragmatic, and not overly theoretical or
prescriptive. If we don’t see “what’s next” and where it came from, then
it’s probably time to shift focus to something else more practical.

### Resolution 

After noticing that the idea of a can help us focus and help us present
our work to others, we’ve decided to “retire” several patterns that
seemed overly abstract or redundant as well as several antipatterns that
didn’t suggest concrete next steps, and instead simply held a prism to
our collective frustrations with the slow pace of a distributed
volunteer project.[^2] The current catalog is leaner and redescribes our
project in an action-oriented way.

### What’s next 

After significantly pruning back the pattern catalog, we want it to grow
again: new patterns are needed. Reviewing the contents of the will be
one place to look for inspiration, but there are others.[^3]

    patterns in our use a slightly different template to the one we’ve
    currently adopted.

    patterns it contains may prove useful at a later date.
    Symmetrically, one of the tasks of the should be to maintain a “” of
    proto-patterns, in the form of outstanding problems and issues.
