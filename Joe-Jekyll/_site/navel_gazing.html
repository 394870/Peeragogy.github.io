    <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4>

<p>The difficulty breaks down like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly we cannot get things done just by talking about them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And yet, feedback can be useful, i.e., if there are mechanisms for
responding to it in a useful fashion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The associated anti-pattern is a special case of the prototypical
Batesonian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind">double bind</a>,
“the father who says to his son: go ahead, criticize me, but
strongly hints that all effective criticism will be very unwelcome”
<span>[</span>1<span>]</span>, p. 88.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="problem">Problem:</h4>

<p>Criticism is not always useful. Sometimes it is just “noise”.</p>

<h4 id="bogus-solution">(Bogus) Solution:</h4>

<p>It’s tempting to create “open” systems that inadvertantly replicate the
double bind – by being open to criticism, but unable to act on it
effectively.</p>

<h4 id="challenges">Challenges:</h4>

<p>A long list of criticisms that haven’t been dealt with is maybe better
than no communication at all, but it’s also a tell-tale sign of deeper
dissatisfaction. It’s better to make sure you have enough bandwidth (see
<a href="http://peeragogy.org/patterns-usecases/patterns-and-heuristics/carrying-capacity/">Carrying
Capacity</a>)
for dealing with a given class of problems and issues. Adjust your focus
accordingly, but be careful (see
“<a href="http://peeragogy.org/antipatterns/isolation/">Isolation</a>”).</p>

<h4 id="whats-next">What’s Next:</h4>

<p>We have hinted that, in this project, <a href="http://peeragogy.org/how-to-use-this-handbook/">effective criticism is very
welcome</a>! But
understanding what makes criticism effective is, in general, still a
research problem.</p>
