Pattern Audit Routine {#sec:Pattern_Audit_Routine}
=====================

### Context {#context .unnumbered}

As a collection of patterns grows, some of them may lose relevance.

### Problem {#problem .unnumbered}

Not all of the patterns are equally relevant and some will become
completely irrelevant as a project evolves.

### Solution {#solution .unnumbered}

It is important to “tune” and “prune” the collection of patterns. Bring
a real-time aspect to debugging individual patterns using the following
five-part “[Paragogical Action
Review](http://metameso.org/~joe/docs/The-Paragogical-Action-Review.pdf)”
@peeragogy-handbook [Chapter 28]: (1) Review what was supposed to
happen. (2) Establish what is happening/happened. (3) Determine what’s
right and wrong with what we are doing/have done. (4) What did we learn
or change? (5) What else should we change going forward?

After asking these five questions with respect to progress made with any
pattern, the pattern will likely become clearer and/or show its
irrelevance. Periodically run a full audit of the pattern catalog. After
a thorough review, any patterns that cannot be revised to become
relevant for our current interests can be moved to the .

### Rationale {#rationale .unnumbered}

We want to keep the attention focused on the most relevant issues.

### Resolution {#resolution .unnumbered}

This pattern reminds us to improve our patterns, and presents a method
for refocusing.

### What’s Next {#whats-next .unnumbered}

Regularly go through the in our future meetings.
